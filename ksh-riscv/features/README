This directory contains code for platform feature detection. Such as which
header files, functions, syscalls, system libraries are available. Also,
whether syscalls/functions provide specific functionality. It does not
contain any code directly included in `ksh` although it may generate
files (both .h and .c) that are needed to build ksh. Those generated
files should be placed in the `build` directory.

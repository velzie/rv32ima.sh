[+NAME?shift - shift positional parameters]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bshift\b is a shell special built-in that shifts the positional parameters to the left by the number of places defined by \an\a, or \b1\b if \an\a is omitted.  The number of positional parameters remaining will be reduced by the number of places that are shifted.]
[+?If \an\a is given, it will be evaluated as an arithmetic expression to determinate the number of places to shift.  It is an error to shift more than the number of positional parameters or a negative number of places.]

[ n ]

[+EXIT STATUS?]{
[+0?The positional parameters were successfully shifted.]
[+>0?An error occurred.]
}

[+NAME?mkdir - make directories]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bmkdir\b creates one or more directories.  By default, the mode of created directories is \ba=rwx\b minus the bits set in the \bumask\b(1).]
[m:mode]:[mode?Set the mode of created directories to \amode\a.  \amode\a is symbolic or octal mode as in \bchmod\b(1).  Relative modes assume an initial mode of \ba=rwx\b.]
[p:parents?Create any missing intermediate pathname components. For each dir operand that does not name an existing directory, effects equivalent to those caused by the following command shall occur: \vmkdir -p -m $(umask -S),u+wx $(dirname dir) && mkdir [-m mode]] dir\v where the \b-m\b mode option represents that option supplied to the original invocation of \bmkdir\b, if any. Each dir operand that names an existing directory shall be ignored without error.]
[v:verbose?Print a message on the standard error for each created directory.]

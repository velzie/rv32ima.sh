[+NAME?readonly - set readonly attribute on variables]
[+DESCRIPTION?\breadonly\b sets the readonly attribute on each of the variables specified by \aname\a which prevents their values from being changed.  If \b=\b\avalue\a is specified, the variable \aname\a is set to \avalue\a before the variable is made readonly.]
[+?Within a type definition, if the value is not specified, then a value must be specified when creating each instance of the type and the value is readonly for each instance.]
[+?If no \aname\as are specified then the names and values of all readonly variables are written to standard output.]
[+?\breadonly\b is built-in to the shell as a declaration command so that field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the arguments.  Tilde expansion occurs on \avalue\a.]
[p?Causes the output to be in a form of \breadonly\b commands that can be used as input to the shell to recreate the current set of readonly variables.]

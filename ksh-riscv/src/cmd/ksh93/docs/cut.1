[+NAME?cut - cut out selected columns or fields of each line of a file]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bcut\b bytes, characters, or character-delimited fields from one or more files, contatenating them on standard output.]
[+?The option argument \alist\a is a comma-separated or blank-separated list of positive numbers and ranges.  Ranges can be of three forms.  The first is two positive integers separated by a hyphen (\alow\a\b-\b\ahigh\a), which represents all fields from \alow\a to \ahigh\a.  The second is a positive number preceded by a hyphen (\b-\b\ahigh\a), which represents all fields from field \b1\b to \ahigh\a.  The last is a positive number followed by a hyphen (\alow\a\b-\b), which represents all fields from \alow\a to the last field, inclusive.  Elements in the \alist\a can be repeated, can overlap, and can appear in any order.  The order of the output is that of the input.]
[+?One and only one of \b-b\b, \b-c\b, or \b-f\b must be specified.]
[+?If no \afile\a is given, or if the \afile\a is \b-\b, \bcut\b cuts from standard input.   The start of the file is defined as the current offset.]
[b:bytes]:[list?\bcut\b based on a list of byte counts.]
[c:characters]:[list?\bcut\b based on a list of character counts.]
[d:delimiter]:[delim?The field character for the \b-f\b option is set to \adelim\a.  The default is the \btab\b character.]
[f:fields]:[list?\bcut\b based on fields separated by the delimiter character specified with the \b-d\b optiion.]
[n!:split?Split multibyte characters selected by the \b-b\b option.]
[R|r:reclen]#[reclen?If \areclen\a > 0, the input will be read as fixed length records of length \areclen\a when used with the \b-b\b or \b-c\b option.]
[s:suppress|only-delimited?Suppress lines with no delimiter characters, when used with the \b-f\b option.  By default, lines with no delimiters will be passsed in untouched.]
[D:line-delimeter|output-delimiter]:[ldelim?The line delimiter character for the \b-f\b option is set to \aldelim\a.  The default is the \bnewline\b character.]
[N!:newline?Output new-lines at end of each record when used with the \b-b\b or \b-c\b option.]

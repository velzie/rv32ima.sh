[+NAME?eval - create a shell command and process it]
[+DESCRIPTION?\beval\b is a shell special built-in command that constructs a command by concatenating the \aarg\as together, separating each with a space.  The resulting string is then taken as input to the shell and evaluated in the current environment.  Note that command words are expanded twice; once to construct \aarg\a, and again when the shell executes the constructed command.]
[+?It is not an error if \aarg\a is not given.]

[arg...]

[+EXIT STATUS?If \aarg\a is not specified, the exit status is \b0\b.  Otherwise, it is the exit status of the command defined by the \aarg\a operands.]
[+SEE ALSO?\bexec\b(1), \btrap\b(1), \b.\b(1)]

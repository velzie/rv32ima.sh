[+NAME?wc - print the number of bytes, words, and lines in files]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bwc\b reads one or more input files and, by default, for each file writes a line containing the number of newlines, \aword\as, and bytes contained in each file followed by the file name to standard output in that order.  A \aword\a is defined to be a non-zero length string delimited by \bisspace\b(3) characters.]
[+?If more than one file is specified, \bwc\b writes a total count for all of the named files with \btotal\b written instead of the file name.]
[+?By default, \bwc\b writes all three counts.  Options can specified so that only certain counts are written.  The options \b-c\b and \b-m\b are mutually exclusive.]
[+?If no \afile\a is given, or if the \afile\a is \b-\b, \bwc\b reads from standard input and no filename is written to standard output.  The start of the file is defined as the current offset.]
[l:lines?List the line counts.]
[w:words?List the word counts.]
[c:bytes|chars:chars?List the byte counts.]
[m|C:multibyte-chars?List the character counts.]
[q:quiet?Suppress invalid multibyte character warnings.]
[L:longest-line|max-line-length?List the longest line length; the newline,
if any, is not counted in the length.]
[N!:utf8?For \bUTF-8\b locales \b--noutf8\b disables \bUTF-8\b optimzations and relies on the native \bmbtowc\b(3).]

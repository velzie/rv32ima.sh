[+NAME?sleep - suspend execution for an interval]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bsleep\b suspends execution for at least the time specified by \aduration\a or until a \bSIGALRM\b signal is received. \aduration\a may be one of the following:]
{
[+floating point?The number of seconds to sleep. The actual granularity depends on the underlying system, normally around 1 millisecond. This can be followed by \bs\b for seconds, \bm\b for minutes, \bh\b for hours, or \bd\b for days.]
[+P\an\a\bY\b\an\a\bM\b\an\a\bDT\b\an\a\bH\b\an\a\bM\b\an\a\bS?An ISO 8601 duration where at least one of the duration parts must be specified.]
[+P\an\a\bW?An ISO 8601 duration specifying \an\a weeks.]
[+p\an\a\bY\b\an\a\bM\b\an\a\bDT\b\an\a\bH\b\an\a\bm\b\an\a\bS?A case insensitive ISO 8601 duration except that \bM\b specifies months, \bm\b before \bs\b or \bS\b specifies minutes and after specifies milliseconds, \bu\b or \bU\b specifies microseconds, and \bn\b specifies nanoseconds.]
[+date/time?Sleep until the \bdate\b(1) compatible date/time.]
}
[s?Sleep until a signal or a timeout is received. If \aduration\a is omitted or 0 then no timeout will be used.]

[ duration ]

[+EXIT STATUS?]{
[+0?The execution was successfully suspended for at least \aduration\a or a \bSIGALRM\b signal was received.]
[+>0?An error occurred.]
}

[+NAME?whence - locate a command and describe its type]
[+DESCRIPTION?Without \b-v\b, \bwhence\b writes on standard output an absolute pathname, if any, corresponding to \aname\a based on the complete search order that the shell uses.  If \aname\a is not found, then no output is produced.]
[+?If \b-v\b is specified, the output will also contain information that indicates how the given \aname\a would be interpreted by the shell in the current execution environment.]
[P?Do not check to see if \aname\a is a reserved word, a built-in, an alias, or a function.  This turns off the \b-v\b option.]
[a?Displays all uses for each \aname\a rather than the first.]
[f?Do not check for functions.]
[p?Do not check to see if \aname\a is a reserved word, a built-in, an alias, or a function.  This turns off the \b-v\b option.]
[t?Output only the type for each command.]
[q?Quiet mode. Returns 0 if all arguments are built-ins, functions, or are programs found on the path.]
[v?For each name you specify, the shell displays a line that indicates if that name is one of the following:]{
[+?Reserved word]
[+?Alias]
[+?Built-in]
[+?Undefined function]
[+?Function]
[+?Tracked alias]
[+?Program]
}

name  ...

[+EXIT STATUS?]{
[+0?Each \aname\a was found by the shell.]
[+1?One or more \aname\as were not found by the shell.]
[+>1?An error occurred.]
}
[+SEE ALSO?\bcommand\b(1)]

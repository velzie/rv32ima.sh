[+NAME?umask - get or set the file creation mask]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bumask\b sets the file creation mask of the current shell execution environment to the value specified by the \amask\a operand.  This mask affects the file permission bits of subsequently created files.  \amask\a can either be an octal number or a symbolic value as described in \bchmod\b(1).  If a symbolic value is given, the new file creation mask is the complement of the result of applying \amask\a to the complement of the current file creation mask.]
[+?If \amask\a is not specified, \bumask\b writes the value of the file creation mask for the current process to standard output.]
[S?Causes the file creation mask to be written or treated as a symbolic value rather than an octal number.]
[p?Write the file creation mask in a format that can be use for re-input.]

[+EXIT STATUS?]{
[+0?The file creation mask was successfully changed, or no \amask\a operand was supplied.]
[+>0?An error occurred.]
}

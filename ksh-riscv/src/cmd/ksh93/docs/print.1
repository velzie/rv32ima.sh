[+NAME?print - write arguments to standard output]
[+DESCRIPTION?By default, \bprint\b writes each \astring\a operand to standard output and appends a newline character.]
[+?Unless, the \b-r\b or \b-f\b option is specified, each \b\\\b character in each \astring\a operand is processed specially as follows:]{
[+\\a?Alert character.]
[+\\b?Backspace character.]
[+\\c?Terminate output without appending newline.  The remaining \astring\a operands are ignored.]
[+\\f?Formfeed character.]
[+\\n?Newline character.]
[+\\t?Tab character.]
[+\\v?Vertical tab character.]
[+\\\\?Backslash character.]
[+\\E?Escape character (ASCII octal 033).]
[+\\0\ax\a?The 8-bit character whose ASCII code is the 1-, 2-, or 3-digit octal number \ax\a.]
}
[+?If both \b-e\b and \b-r\b are specified, the last one specified is the one that is used.]
[+?When the \b-f\b option is specified and there are more \astring\a operands than format specifiers, the format string is reprocessed from the beginning.  If there are fewer \astring\a operands than format specifiers, then outputting will end at the first unneeded format specifier.]
[e?Unless \b-f\b is specified, process \b\\\b sequences in each \astring\a operand as described above. This is the default behavior.]
[n?Do not append a new-line character to the output.]
[f]:[format?Write the \astring\a arguments using the format string \aformat\a and do not append a new-line.  See \bprintf\b for details on how to specify \aformat\a.]
[p?Write to the current co-process instead of standard output.  Obsolete, use \b-u p\b instead.]
[r?Do not process \b\\\b sequences in each \astring\a operand as described above.]
[s?Write the output as an entry in the shell history file instead of standard output.]
[u]:[fd:=1?Write to file descriptor number \afd\a instead of standard output. If \afd\a is \bp\b, the co-process output file descriptor is used.]
[v?Treat each \astring\a as a variable name and write the value in \b%B\b format.  Cannot be used with \b-f\b.]
[C?Treat each \astring\a as a variable name and write the value in \b%#B\b format.  Cannot be used with \b-f\b.]

[+EXIT STATUS?]{

[+NAME?unset - unset values and attributes of variables and functions]
[+DESCRIPTION?For each \aname\a specified, \bunset\b  unsets the variable, or function if \b-f\b is specified, from the current shell execution environment.  Readonly variables cannot be unset.]
[n?If \aname\a refers to variable that is a reference, the variable \aname\a will be unset rather than the variable it references.  Otherwise, is is equivalent to \b-v\b.]
[f?\aname\a refers to a function name and the shell will unset the function definition.]
[v?\aname\a refers to a variable name and the shell will unset it and remove it from the environment.  This is the default behavior.]

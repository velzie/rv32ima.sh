[+NAME?cat - concatenate files]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bcat\b copies each \afile\a in sequence to the standard output. If no \afile\a is given, or if the \afile\a is \b-\b, \bcat\b copies from standard input starting at the current location.]
[b:number-nonblank?Number lines as with \b-n\b but omit line numbers from blank lines.]
[d:dos-input?Input files are opened in \atext\amode which removes carriage returns in front of new-lines on some systems.]
[e?Equivalent to \b-vE\b.]
[n:number?Causes a line number to be inserted at the beginning of each line.]
[s?Equivalent to \b-S\b for \aatt\a universe and \b-B\b otherwise.]
[t?Equivalent to \b-vT\b.]
[u:unbuffer?The output is not delayed by buffering.]
[v:show-nonprinting|print-chars?Print characters as follows: space and printable characters as themselves; control characters as \b^\b followed by a letter of the alphabet; and characters with the high bit set as the lower 7 bit character prefixed by \bM^\b for 7 bit non-printable characters and \bM-\b for all other characters. If the 7 bit character encoding is not ASCII then the characters are converted to ASCII to determine \ahigh bit set\a, and if set it is cleared and converted back to the native encoding. Multibyte characters in the current locale are treated as printable characters.]
[A:show-all?Equivalent to \b-vET\b.]
[B:squeeze-blank?Multiple adjacent new-line characters are replace by one new-line.]
[D:dos-output?Output files are opened in \atext\amode which inserts carriage returns in front of new-lines on some systems.]
[E:show-ends?Causes a \b$\b to be inserted before each new-line.]
[S:silent?\bcat\b is silent about non-existent files.]
[T:show-blank?Causes tabs to be copied as \b^I\b and formfeeds as \b^L\b.]

[+NAME?uname - identify the current system ]
[+DESCRIPTION?By default \buname\b writes the operating system name to
   standard output. When options are specified, one or more
   system characteristics are written to standard output, space
   separated, on a single line. When more than one option is specified
   the output is in the order specfied by the \b-A\b option below.
   Unsupported option values are listed as \a[option]]\a. If any unknown
   options are specified then the local \b/usr/bin/uname\b is called.]
[+?If any \aname\a operands are specified then the \bsysinfo\b(2) values
   for each \aname\a are listed, separated by space, on one line.
   \bgetconf\b(1), a pre-existing \astandard\a interface, provides
   access to the same information; vendors should spend more time
   using standards than inventing them.]
[+?Selected information is printed in the same order as the options below.]
[a:all?Equivalent to \b-snrvmpio\b.]
[s:system|sysname|kernel-name?The detailed kernel name. This is the default.]
[n:nodename?The hostname or nodename.]
[r:release|kernel-release?The kernel release level.]
[v:version|kernel-version?The kernel version level.]
[m:machine?The name of the hardware type the system is running on.]
[p:processor?The name of the processor instruction set architecture.]
[i:implementation|platform|hardware-platform?The hardware implementation;
   this is \b--host-id\b on some systems.]
[o:operating-system?The generic operating system name.]
[h:host-id|id?The host id in hex.]
[d:domain?The domain name returned by \agetdomainname\a(2).]

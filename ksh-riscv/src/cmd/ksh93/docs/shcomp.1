[+NAME?shcomp - compile a shell script]
[+DESCRIPTION?Unless \b-D\b is specified, \bshcomp\b takes a shell script, \ainfile\a, and creates a binary format file, \aoutfile\a, that \bksh\b can read and execute with the same effect as the original script.]
[+?Since aliases are processed as the script is read, alias definitions whose value requires variable expansion will not work correctly.]
[+?If \b-D\b is specified, all double quoted strings that are preceded by \b$\b are output.  These are the messages that need to be translated to locale specific versions for internationalization.]
[+?If \aoutfile\a is omitted, then the results will be written to standard output.  If \ainfile\a is also omitted, the shell script will be read from standard input.]
[D:dictionary?Generate a list of strings that need to be placed in a message catalog for internationalization.]
[n:noexec?Displays warning messages for obsolete or non-conforming constructs.]
[v:verbose?Displays input from \ainfile\a onto standard error as it reads it.]

[infile [outfile]]

[+EXIT STATUS?]{

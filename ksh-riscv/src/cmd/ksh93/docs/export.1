[+NAME?export - set export attribute on variables]
[+DESCRIPTION?\bexport\b sets the export attribute on each of the variables specified by \aname\a which causes them to be in the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If \b=\b\avalue\a is specified, the variable \aname\a is set to \avalue\a.]
[+?If no \aname\as are specified then the names and values of all exported variables are written to standard output.]
[+?\bexport\b is built-in to the shell as a declaration command so that field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the arguments.  Tilde expansion occurs on \avalue\a.]
[n?Remove the variable from the export list.]
[p?Causes the output to be in the form of \bexport\b commands that can be used as input to the shell to recreate the current exports.]
